## Purpose 

An agent that learns how to play different game theoretical games through reinforcement learning

## Requirements

1) Running on TensorForce (https://github.com/reinforceio/tensorforce) because that way I have access to a bunch of stable templates 
2) It needs to be able to learn purely from state inference (so it will infer the game theoretical matrix as opposed to having it programmed before hand)
3) It needs to be able to self-play
